# Automate Infrastructure With IaC using Terraform. Part 4 â€“ Terraform Cloud

- Terraform Cloud is a managed service that provides you with Terraform CLI to provision infrastructure, either on demand or in response to various events.
- Terraform Cloud executes Terraform commands on disposable virtual machines, this remote execution is also called remote operations.

# Step 1: Created a Terraform Cloud account and an organization

# Step 3: Configured variables
- Terraform Cloud supports two types of variables: environment variables and Terraform variables. Either type can be marked as sensitive, which prevents them from being displayed in the Terraform Cloud web UI and makes them write-only.

- Set two environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

# Step 5 : Builing Packer Images

- Running the packer commands to build AMI for Bastion server, Nginx server and webserver

 ### For Bastion Server

# Step 5 : Running The Terraform Cloud To Provision Resources
- Inputing the AMI ID in my terraform.tfvars file for the servers built with packer which terraform will use to provision Bastion, Nginx, Tooling and Wordpress server.
