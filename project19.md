# Automate Infrastructure With IaC using Terraform. Part 4 â€“ Terraform Cloud

- Terraform Cloud is a managed service that provides you with Terraform CLI to provision infrastructure, either on demand or in response to various events.
- Terraform Cloud executes Terraform commands on disposable virtual machines, this remote execution is also called remote operations.

# Step 1: Created a Terraform Cloud account and an organization

# Step 2: Configure a version control workflow workspace

# Step 3: Configured variables
- Terraform Cloud supports two types of variables: environment variables and Terraform variables. Either type can be marked as sensitive, which prevents them from being displayed in the Terraform Cloud web UI and makes them write-only.

- Set two environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

# Step 4: Installed Packer and Ansible

- AMI: for building packer images
- Ansible: for Ansible scripts to configure the

# Step 5 : Builing Packer Images

- Running the packer commands to build AMI for Bastion server, Nginx server and webserver

 ### For Bastion Server

 ### For Nginx Server

 ### For Tooling and Wordpress Server

  ### For Jenkins, Artifactory and sonarqube Server

 - Final output of the created AMIs

# Step 6: Running The Terraform Cloud To Provision Resources
- Inputing the AMI ID in my terraform.tfvars file for the servers built with packer which terraform will use to provision Bastion, Nginx, Tooling and Wordpress server.

 - Pushing the code to my github repo will cause a trigger plan on my terraform cloud workspace, so i accepted the plan and automatically did a terraform apply of my infrastructure.

  # Step 7 : Configuring The Infrastructure With Ansible
  - Connected to the bastion  server on my vs code to run ansible scripts for the infrastructure.

 - Updating the nginx.conf.j2 file to input the internal load balancer dns name generated via terraform:

- Updated the RDS endpoints, Database name, password and username in the setup-db.yml file for both the tooling and wordpress role

   ![alt text](https://github.com/Ellawangari/DevOps-Advanced-Projects/blob/main/Imgs/prj19/17.PNG)
  
- Updated the EFS Access point ID for both the wordpress and tooling role in the main.yml
- For tooling.

- For Wordpress

 - Verified the inventory using dynamic inventory.

- Exported the environment variable ANSIBLE_CONFIG to point to the ansible.cfg from the repo and running the ansible-playbook command: $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/aws_ec2.yml playbook/site.yml

# Step 8:  Setting Slack Notification For trigger Events
- On the setting tab selected notification, selecting slack option.

# Step 9:  Setting The Terraform Cloud To Execute Only From 'Dev' Branch
- Created 3 branches dev, prod and test.
![alt text](https://github.com/Ellawangari/DevOps-Advanced-Projects/blob/main/Imgs/prj19/branches.PNG)

- On the version control page in the settings tab, setting the VCS branch to dev.
![alt text](https://github.com/Ellawangari/DevOps-Advanced-Projects/blob/main/Imgs/prj19/dev.PNG)

- Pushed the code and the terraform plan was executed on the dev branch thus triggering a notification on my slack channel.

# Step 9:  Confirmed my infrastructure and performed a terraform destroy on it.

- Confirmed the tooling and wordpress sites created by the infrastructure.
- For tooling
